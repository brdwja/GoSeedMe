# GoSeedMe
In this Hackfest 2024 our team will be making an application called "GoSeedMe" that based on the 17 SDGS according to The United Nations Goals to make or transform our world to be a better world for continuous living. Therefore, we choose SDGS number 8 about Decent Work and Economic Growth, also number 13 about Climate Action. GoSeedMe is an application that aims public to be care to our environment or nature especially to contribute to our forests and society. GoSeedMe is not just an application that cares about the environment, but also cares about the local SME's (Small, Micro, and Entrepreneur) that aims the productive ages from range 17 to 40 years old to selling their green product sustainably by online and make a possible income for a better living.
